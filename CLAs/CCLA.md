Corporate Contributor License Agreement
KWDB 项目法人贡献者许可协议

2025-4-10 updated  

Thank you for your interest in the KWDB  Project (the “Project”) incubated and hosted by the OpenAtom Foundation (the “Foundation”). The Foundation is on behalf of the Project, and is also the legal entity that is making this Agreement with you.
非常感谢您对开放原子开源基金会（“基金会”）孵化和托管的KWDB 项目（“本项目”）感兴趣！ 基金会是代表本项目并与您签订本协议的法人实体。

In order to clarify the rights granted with Contributions from any person or entity, the Project must have a Contributor License Agreement (the “Agreement” or “CLA”) on file that has been signed by each Contributor, indicating agreement to the license terms below. This Agreement is for Your protection as a Contributor as well as the protection of the Project and its users; it does not change Your rights to use Your own Contributions for any other purpose.
为明确由任何实体就“贡献”授予的知识产权许可，本项目的每个贡献者须签署一份《贡献者许可协议》（“本协议”或“CLA”）并交由基金会存档，表明其同意如下许可条款。本协议将贵方作为贡献者进行保护，且同时也保护本项目及其用户；但不会改变贵方为其他目的使用贵方所拥有的“贡献”的权利。

This version of the Agreement allows any entity (a “Corporation”) to submit Contributions, authorize Contributions from its designated employees who may have assigned rights in such Contributions to the Corporation, typically pursuant to their employment agreements with the Corporation and to grant copyright and patent licenses thereto. 
本版本的本协议允许任何实体（“公司 ”）为向本项目提交“贡献”，授权其指定雇员向本项目提交“贡献”并授予相应的著作权和专利许可，这些雇员通常根据其与“公司”签订的雇佣协议将“贡献”的权利转让给了该等“公司”。

Please read this CLA carefully before completing and signing it, and keep a copy for Your records. 
请在填写和签署本协议之前请仔细阅读本协议内容，并保留一份CLA副本作为贵方的记录。

The rights that You grant to us under these terms are effective on the date You and Your designated employees first submitted a Contribution to this Project, even if Your submission took place before the date You agreed to these terms and conditions. Except for the license granted herein to the Project and recipients of the Work distributed by the Project, You reserve all rights, title and interest in and to Your Contributions.
贵方根据这些条款授予我们的权利自贵方和贵方指定的雇员首次向本项目提交“贡献”之日起生效，即使贵方的提交是在贵方同意这些条款和条件之前进行的。除本协议授予本项目和本项目所分发“本作品”的接收者的许可外，贵方保留对您的“贡献”的所有权利、产权和利益。

“Contributor” or “You” (or “Your”) shall mean the individual copyright owner or legal entity authorized by the copyright owner that is making this agreement with the Foundation, and voluntarily submits a Contribution to the Project.

“贡献者”或“贵方”/“您”系指与基金会订立本协议并自愿向本项目提交“贡献”的著作权人或经著作权人授权的个人或法人实体。对于法人实体，作出“贡献”的实体以及控制该实体、受该实体控制或与该实体共同被控制的所有其他实体，均被视为单一贡献者。本条款定义的“控制”系指：（i）通过合同或其他方式，拥有直接或间接领导或管理该实体的权力，或（ii）拥有该实体50%及以上的流通股份，或（iii）拥有该实体的实益所有权。

“Contribution” shall mean the code, documentation, or any original work of authorship, including a modification of or addition to an existing work, that is intentionally submitted by You  for inclusion in the work of the Project (the “Work”). For the purposes of this definition, “submitted” means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the Project or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Project for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by You as “Not a Contribution”.

2. Contributor Grant of Copyright License.
著作权许可的授予

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to the Project, and to all who directly or indirectly receive the Work a perpetual, non-exclusive, worldwide, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute Your Contribution and derivative works thereof. 
贵方基于本协议的条款及条件，特此授予本项目和所有直接或间接接收“本作品”的一方永久的、非排他的、全球性的、免交易费的、免许可费的、不可撤销的著作权许可，以复制、修改、准备衍生作品、公开展示、公开运行、分许可和分发贵方的“贡献”及其衍生作品。

专利权许可的授予

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to the Project, and to  all who directly or indirectly receive the Work, a perpetual, non-exclusive, worldwide, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work; provided, however, that such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by You that are necessarily infringed by Your Contribution(s) alone or by combination of Your Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) were submitted. If any entity institutes patent litigation against You or any other entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that You or such other entity has directly or contributory infringed a patent as a result of some act of making, having made, using, offering to sell, selling, or importing Your Contribution, or the combination of Your Contribution with the Work to which You submitted the Contribution, then any patent license granted by You under this CLA to the entity instituting patent litigation shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
基于本协议，贵方特此授予本项目和所有直接或间接接收“本作品”的一方永久的、全球性的、非排他的、免交易费的、免许可费的、不可撤销的（本条款下述情形除外）专利许可，以制造、委托制造、使用、许诺销售、销售、进口和以其他方式转移“本作品”。该专利许可仅及于贵方有权授予且将因贵方“贡献”本身、或因贵方“贡献”与其被提交到的“本作品”的结合所必然侵犯的专利权利要求。如果任何实体针对贵方或其他实体提起专利诉讼（包括诉讼中的交叉诉讼或反诉），指控贵方“贡献”或前述结合构成专利的直接侵权或帮助侵权，则任何根据本协议就该“贡献”或“本作品”授予该实体的专利许可自该实体提起该诉讼之日起终止。

Apart from the licenses granted in section 2 & 3, You reserve all right, title and interest in and to Your Contribution.
除了第2条和第3条中授予的许可外，贵方保留对您的“贡献”的所有权利、产权和利益。


4. You represent that Your Contribution is Your original work (see section 6 for submissions on behalf of others). You represent that Your submission of Your Contribution includes complete details of any third-party license or other restriction (including, but not limited to, related copyrights, patents and trademarks) of which You are  aware and which are associated with any part of Your Contribution.
贵方承诺，您的“贡献”是您的原创作品（代表他人提交见第6条）。贵方承诺，您提交的“贡献”包括您知道并与您“贡献”的任何部分相关的任何第三方许可或其他限制（包括但不限于相关著作权、专利和商标）的完整详细信息。

5. You are not expected to provide support for Your Contributions, except to the extent You desire to provide support. You may provide support for free, for a fee, or not at all. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, You provide Your Contribution on an “AS IS” BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
除非贵方自愿，否则贵方无需为贵方“贡献”提供支持服务。贵方可以提供免费或收费支持服务，也可以完全不提供支持服务。除非适用法律另有规定或另有书面约定，您“按原样”提供您的“贡献”，而不对其提供任何类型的担保或条件，无论明示还是默示，包括但不限于产权、不侵权、适销性或特定目的适用性的担保或条件。

6. Should You wish to submit work that is not Your original work, You may submit it to the Project separately from Your Contribution, identifying the complete details of its origin and of any license or other restriction (including, but not limited to, related copyrights, patents and trademarks) of which You are aware, and conspicuously marking the work to show it has been submitted on behalf of a third party and the name of that party.
如果贵方拟提交非贵方原创作品，贵方可以将该部分内容与贵方“贡献”进行区分后提交给本项目，并根据贵方所知标识该部分内容的来源以及任何许可或其他限制（包括但不限于相关专利、商标和许可协议）的完整细节，并以显著方式注明该作品系“代第三方提交”并注明第三方名称。
